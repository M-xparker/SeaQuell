A Journey into Building Databases

This databases has the following components:
- SQL Compiler (lexer borrows heavily from Go's text/template library)
- Virtual Machine
- B+ Tree

Current working commands:
- CREATE TABLE
- SELECT FROM
- INSERT INTO

This is still in rough draft mode.

## Learning
When starting this project, not much info was available outside of textbooks. I walk through the different parts of the database in the following blog posts:
